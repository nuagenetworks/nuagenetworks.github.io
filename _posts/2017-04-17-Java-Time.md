title: Java and the Nuage VSPK - Part 1 - Introduction
author: Leonard Paquette
callout_image: nuage-community-header.jpg
excerpt: Nuage Networks now offers a Java library known as `VSPK-Java` to access their Nuage VSP Platform. By using VSPK-Java, developers are able to use Java as an entry point wrapper to access the RESTful APIs of the Virtualized Services Directory (`VSD`).  In Part 1 of this series, we introduce `VSPK-Java` and provide a couple of simple examples to get you started.

# Product Overview
The `VSP` (Virtualized Services Platform) is a product from Nuage Networks that provides SDN (Software-Defined Network) automation.  One of its key components is `VSD` (Virtualized Services Directory), a programmable engine that supports the abstract definition of network services.  The `VSD` provides a RESTful API through which network administrators can implement the service designs and access policies of their enterprise.

The `VSD` RESTful API, just like any standard RESTFul web service, can be consumed in various ways, from a simple browser-based URI request, to a programming language like Python or Java.  Nuage Networks has published open-source projects in several popular programming languages that provide adaptive layers to the RESTful API.  Besides Java, the focus of this blog, there are SDKs for Go, Objective-J and Python.

Underlying each language specific SDK is a low-level communications library known as Bambou.  Each implementation of Bambou provides an objected oriented layer for manipulating REST objects within the `VSD`.  

Here are some references for downloads and details about the SDK's that support the `VSD` RESTful API:

# Getting Started
To start using the VSPK-Java library, you will need to deploy 2 Jar files into your development environment. The `vspk` jar file provides the layer through which your custom Java code will make calls to manipulate VSD entities such as domains, virtual machines and access policies.  The `bambou` jar file is a dependency of the `vspk` jar file and provides an object-oriented abstraction layer for the lower-level REST calls that are managed by the Spring Framework HTTP Client/Server package.

At the time of this writing, the latest versions of the 2 files are vspk-4.0.8.jar and bambou-2.0.2.jar.  In the future, we expect to make these libraries available in the Central `Maven` Repository.  The link below will direct you to the latest, public versions of the jar files, along with their prior releases and any notes on JRE dependencies. You can download the latest versions [here](https://github.com/nuagenetworks/vspk-java/releases/tag/r4.0.8).

## Setup with Maven
Since most Java developers are using `Maven` to build their projects, the 2 jar files are accompanied by `pom.xml` files that provide build profiles and project dependencies.  If you are using Maven, ensure that the jar files are copied into your local `Maven` cache repository.

For `vspk` , the path from your local repository will look similar to this:

 `C:\Users\lpaquett\.m2\repository\net\nuagenetworks\vspk\4.0.8`

For `bambou` , the path from your local repository will look similar to this:

`C:\Users\lpaquett\.m2\repository\net\nuagenetworks\bambou\2.0.2`

## Setup without Maven
If you are not using `Maven` as a build tool, then you will have some extra work to do to install the `vspk` and `bambou` files.  Instead of copying the 2 jar files to a Maven cache structure, you will need to places the files and their dependencies on your project's build path.  

First, copy the 2 jar files into the directory matching the `libraries` location on your Java build path.  In many cases, this will be named `lib`, and there may already be some files installed there that are referenced in your project.

Second, review the `pom.xml` files for both jar files to determine their dependencies and then manually download and copy dependent jar files onto your build path.  You will see details such as `groupId`, `artifactId` and `version` for first-level dependencies that can be used to search for the appropriate downloadable files in the Central Maven Repository.

You will see entries, like those shown below, from the 2 pom files:

```
<dependencies>
	<dependency>
		<groupId>org.slf4j</groupId>
		<artifactId>slf4j-api</artifactId>
		<version>1.7.18</version>
	</dependency>
	<dependency>
		<groupId>com.fasterxml.jackson.core</groupId>
		<artifactId>jackson-databind</artifactId>
		<version>2.7.2</version>
	</dependency>
	<dependency>
		<groupId>org.springframework</groupId>
		<artifactId>spring-web</artifactId>
		<version>4.2.5.RELEASE</version>
	</dependency>
	<dependency>
		<groupId>commons-codec</groupId>
		<artifactId>commons-codec</artifactId>
		<version>1.10</version>
	</dependency>
	<dependency>
		<groupId>org.jboss.as</groupId>
		<artifactId>jboss-as-jms-client-bom</artifactId>
		<version>7.1.1.Final</version>
		<type>pom</type>
	</dependency>
	<dependency>
		<groupId>org.springframework</groupId>
		<artifactId>spring-test</artifactId>
		<version>4.2.5.RELEASE</version>
		<scope>test</scope>
	</dependency>
	<dependency>
		<groupId>junit</groupId>
		<artifactId>junit</artifactId>
		<version>4.12</version>
		<scope>test</scope>
	</dependency>
	<dependency>
		<groupId>org.easymock</groupId>
		<artifactId>easymock</artifactId>
		<version>3.4</version>
		<scope>test</scope>
	</dependency>
	<dependency>
		<groupId>org.slf4j</groupId>
		<artifactId>slf4j-simple</artifactId>
		<version>1.7.18</version>
		<scope>test</scope>
	</dependency>
</dependencies>
```

From the pom file snippet above, you can see that `bambou` has a dependency on the Spring Framework.  This means you will need to supply not only the Spring Web artifact, but also all its dependencies.  Your Java IDE environment will throw build errors until all nested dependencies have been resolved.  In this particular case, you need to download and install file `spring-web-4.2.5.RELEASE.jar`.  To locate this file, you can search the Central Maven Repository [here](https://search.maven.org/).


# VSD Setup
Note that as a precondition to using the VSPK-Java library, you will need to have a running `VSD` server with sufficient update permissions.  If you have access to a `VSD` test environment, then it has likely been configured with an administrative user having username/password credentials `csproot/csproot`, a default enterprise `csp` and a port number `8443`.  Please contact your administration team for connection details such as network address.

Nuage Networks offers a well-designed `VSD` web interface known as `VSA` (Virtualized Services Architect) that provides a visual representation of your `VSP` and allows you to actually update your `SDN` entities directly.  For our purposes, we can use the `VSA` to test our login credentials and verify that our Java programs are working.

To access the `VSA`, enter an appropriate address and port in your browser based on the network location of your local `VSD`.  Your URL should resemble this:

```
https://135.121.118.59:8443/
```

If your `VSD` is running on the port that you have provided, you will see a login screen similar to this:

![VSA login screen][VSA-Login]

After entering valid credentials and enterprise (a.k.a. organization), you will see a home page similar to this:

![VSA home page][VSA-Home-Page]


# Hello Enterprise
Once you have verified that your `VSD` is running and that you have credentials to access it, let's continue with everyone's favorite and traditional Hello World sanity test to make sure that all of the software components are installed correctly in your development environment.  But instead of just logging `Hello World` to your console, you will initialize a new Enterprise entity called `Hello Enterprise` in your `VSD`.  Here is a runnable Java program to do just that:

{% highlight java %}
import net.nuagenetworks.bambou.RestException;
import net.nuagenetworks.vspk.v4_0.Enterprise;
import net.nuagenetworks.vspk.v4_0.Me;
import net.nuagenetworks.vspk.v4_0.VSDSession;

public class CreateHelloEnterprise {
  public static void main(String[] args) throws RestException {
    VSDSession session = new VSDSession
        ("csproot", "csproot", "csp", "https://135.121.118.59:8443"); // 1
    session.start(); // 2
    Me me = session.getMe(); // 3
    Enterprise enterprise = new Enterprise(); // 4
    enterprise.setName("HelloEnterprise"); // 5
    me.createChild(enterprise); // 6
  }
}
{% endhighlight %}

The first step is to establish a `VSD` session.  In line 1, we provide a valid set of username/password credentials and the location of the `VSD`.  You will need to provide an appropriate address for your `VSD`.  In Line 2, we start the session.

{% highlight java %}
  VSDSession session = new VSDSession
        ("csproot", "csproot", "csp", "https://135.121.118.59:8443"); // 1
  session.start(); // 2
{% endhighlight %}

Recall that the `Bambou` layer provides an object-oriented approach for us to manage our network objects in the `VSD`.  Consider the `Me` object as the root of your network object hierarchy.  In Line 3, we need to instantiate a `Me` object to serve as the root for all of our enterprise specific network objects.

{% highlight java %}
  Me me = session.getMe(); // 3
{% endhighlight %}

Now that we have a `Me` root object, we can begin to build child objects and attach them.  In lines 4 and 5, we initialize a new Enterprise object and give it a name.  Finally, in Line 6, we attach the new Enterprise object to our root `Me` Object.

{% highlight java %}
  Enterprise enterprise = new Enterprise(); // 4
  enterprise.setName("HelloEnterprise"); // 5
  me.createChild(enterprise); // 6
{% endhighlight %}

Behind the scenes, as our Java code was executed, REST calls were constructed by the Spring Framework and sent to the `VSD`, where our session was authenticated and our new Enterprise resource was created.  If the code completed successfully, you will see an update in `VSA`.

# Goodbye Enterprise
Let's be a good citizen and clean up the `VSD`.  Here is another Java program to remove the Enterprise that we just created:

{% highlight java %}
import net.nuagenetworks.bambou.RestException;
import net.nuagenetworks.vspk.v4_0.Enterprise;
import net.nuagenetworks.vspk.v4_0.Me;
import net.nuagenetworks.vspk.v4_0.VSDSession;
import net.nuagenetworks.vspk.v4_0.fetchers.EnterprisesFetcher;

public class DeleteHelloEnterprise {
  public static void main(String[] args) throws RestException {
    VSDSession session = new VSDSession
        ("csproot", "csproot", "csp", "https://135.121.118.59:8443"); // 1
    session.start(); // 2
    Me me = session.getMe(); // 3
    String filter = String.format("name == '%s'", "HelloEnterprise"); // 4
    EnterprisesFetcher fetcher = me.getEnterprises(); // 5
    Enterprise enterprise =
        fetcher.getFirst(filter, null, null, null, null, null, true); // 6
    enterprise.delete(); // 7
  }
}
{% endhighlight %}

Lines 1 through 3 should be very familiar, since they are identical to the lines at the start of `CreateHelloEnterprise.java`.  Then in Line 4, we construct a name filter so that we can search for Enterprise `HelloEnterprise` among other existing enterprises in the `VSD`.

{% highlight java %}
  String filter = String.format("name == '%s'", "HelloEnterprise"); // 4
{% endhighlight %}

In Line 5, we execute the `getEnterprises()` method on the `Me` object to return a collection of all Enterprise objects in the  `VSD`.  The object type actually returned is `EnterprisesFetcher`, which supports various operations for searching and fetching from a collection of Enterprises.

{% highlight java %}
  EnterprisesFetcher fetcher = me.getEnterprises(); // 5
{% endhighlight %}

In Line 6, we apply the name filter against the collection of Enterprises to return a reference to our `HelloEnterprise` resource.  Then, in Line 7 we execute a typical CRUD-styled method to delete the entity from the `VSD`.

{% highlight java %}
  Enterprise enterprise =
    fetcher.getFirst(filter, null, null, null, null, null, true); // 6
  enterprise.delete(); // 7
{% endhighlight %}

Once again, REST calls were constructed by the Spring Framework and sent to the `VSD`, where our session was authenticated and our Enterprise resource was deleted.  If the code completed successfully, you will no longer see the Enterprise in `VSA`.

# Next steps
We've covered the basics of using the `VSPK-Java` library.  This is just one of the tools available from Nuage Networks for the management of your `SDN`.  Network objects can be generated directly using the `VSA`, through REST calls from a browser, from Python, etc.  The `VSPK-Java` library offers a viable alternative for customers with expertise or a preference for Java solutions.
