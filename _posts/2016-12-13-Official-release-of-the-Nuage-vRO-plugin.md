Today, Nuage Networks officially releases its plugin for vRealize Orchestrator, which is available on the VMware Solutions Exchange. This plugin allows customers to use vRealize Orchestrator, a proven orchestration tool from VMware, to fully manage and monitor the Nuage VSP environment through the VSD SDK/API. The plugin comes with over 450 included basic workflows for the typical CRUD operations on any type of object available in the VSD.

Together with the release of this plugin, we are also releasing a set of advanced workflows that can be used with our plugin. This also contains a set of workflows which can be used to integrate Nuage VSP with vCloud Director. 

If you are interested in using our plugin, you can get it in the [VMware Solutions Exchange](https://solutionexchange.vmware.com/store/products/nuage-networks-vsp-vro-plugin), or directly from our [vspk-vro Github repository](https://github.com/nuagenetworks/vspk-vro/releases/latest). The advanced workflows are also available on the [VMware Solutions Exchange](https://solutionexchange.vmware.com/store/products/nuage-networks-vsp-vro-advanced-workflows), or directly from our [vspk-vro-workflows Github repository](https://github.com/nuagenetworks/vspk-vro-workflows/release/latest)

The plugin and the advanced workflows are released as fully open source projects and the source can be found at our [vspk-vro Github repo](https://github.com/nuagenetworks/vspk-vro) and our [vspk-vro-workflows Github repository](https://github.com/nuagenetworks/vspk-vro-workflows). The plugin code is automatically generated from our API specifications with every release. As a result, our plugin will always support the latest Nuage functionality.

Both the plugin and workflows have been in use by various customers over the last months and have proven to be invaluable in the integration within their organisation and their use of the Nuage Networks VSP platform.
